A java based Bruteforce Tool using multiple Threads, this program is not yet perfect

WARNING! DO NOT use this program for malicious purposes, this project is just for fun and should not be used for anything else.

# Information

I have tested the program with a Ryzen 5 6 core processor at 4 GHz and here are the results (I will expand the table in the future)

Important! These times only correspond to my setup, you can achieve worse or even better times.
# How to use it

First make sure you have java installed and its the right Version, so type in your Terminal
> Java -version

If you see something like `openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20` as Output, you have Java installed. If the version is not the latest one please update it  

Open your Terminal where the BruteForce.jar is located, then type 
> Java -jar BruteForce.jar

And hopefully you will receive this message

You can start with cracking password
> Java -jar BruteForce.jar `password` `threads` `debug`

- Examples
	- > Java -jar BruteForce.jar `Julia` `6` `false`
	- > Java -jar BruteForce.jar `Love` `2` `true`

Important! If you set the `debug` to `true`, the bruteforce will take much longer than normal.
